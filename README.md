2. The nearest parking locations for the top 20 infractions are seen on this map. Most different types of infractions are concentrated in Downtown Toronto, which means that vehicle users find it difficult to get a parking spot or wish to avoid paying parking fees.

Also due to the high number of restuarants and busy nature of these streets, food delivery drivers may become easy targets in this area.
